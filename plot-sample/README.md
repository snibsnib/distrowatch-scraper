## This folder contains plot script output

## Usage

1. Gather data with ./parse.sh script as stated.
2. Reformat gathered data with ./results-parse.sh
3. Run ./plotall.sh
4. That's it! You should have 4 fresh PNG graphics laying in the folder.

You might also manually draw countries heatmap with openheatmap.com

## If something goes wrong
Please check the scripts source code, installed dependencies. If nothing helps, please fill me an issue here in github. Thanks.
